-- notes --
-----------
- When the user decides to show the collection along with the variable alias, increase the column width
- Show current alias in the popover as well.
- the variable has a code syntax property where you can define, how it should be defined and used in the
  css file, read that property if present and use it, if not use the default
- use the variables name with collections/group/prefix
- We will implement breadcrumb based navigation in future
- For now, we are not allowing mode selection for a given collection, it will be good to have this in CSS mode

How do I want the search to function?

-- features --

  - We can inform users to use one of the existing tools that supports style dictionary to process the output
    of our plugin

-- limitations --
-----------------

- CSS copy to clipboard needs to be reviewed before being used in your code, the current just
  gives you the raw text
- Your preferences may not be saved and you may have to select the viewMode and the colorMode everytime.


-- Learnings --
--------------

- Try to keep the implementation clean since the beginning
- Be absolutely sure of the things that you want and do not want


json conversion format

- the original name is being stored in variableName property
- for creating variable id from name, everything other than alphadigit is getting converted to _
  - space (' ') gets replaced with _
  - we keep hyphen ('-') as it is
  - group name starts with $
